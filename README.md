# push_swap --- WIP

A work in progress project for 19 coding school. Main objective is to create an efficient sorting algorithm, using 2 stacks and limited operations to perform on them.

As with all projects for the 19 coding school we were only allowed to use a very limited set of functions.

Will be using this repo to store some very rough code that I'm testing atm:

to do list:

 -Parsing: X - working for all types and all errors
 
 -Instructions: X - all instructions work on a doubly linked list
 
 -Sorting: X - will sort efficiently for all sizes
 
 -exit/free all places
 
 -checker
