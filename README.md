# push_swap---WIP

A work in progress project for 42 coding school. Main objective is to create an efficient sorting algorithm, using 2 stacks and limited operations to perform on them>

Will be using this repo to store some very rough code that I'm testing atm:

to do list:
 -Parsing: X - working for all types and all errors
 -Instructions: X - all instructions zork on a doubly linked list
 -Sorting: WIP
 <3: most efficient
 <6: Acceptable
 >6: Way too slow
 -exit/free all places
 -checker
